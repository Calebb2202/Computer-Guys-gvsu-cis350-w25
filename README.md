# The Computer Guys

Description: Python programming langauge learning application which we named Syntax Sensei. The lessons are generated by artificial intelligence and verified by our group to not only be accurate but also helpful. Users will learn Python with our app via practice lessons that will get increasingly more difficult. Our users can save their progress and pick up right where they left off. There is also the capability of searching for a specific lesson and skipping to said lesson.
