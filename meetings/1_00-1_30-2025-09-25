Team name: The Computer Guys

Members present: Poom and Caleb

Date: 09/25/25

Time: 1:00-1:30

Discussion points: 
- Gave new project proposal and milestones
- Discussed what we're using for both backend and frontend
- Talked about making a flow/diagram for what we want to do and how to navigate the user
- Talked about adding "gaming" elements. Maybe something like a belt system the more you progress or just a simple progress bar for lessons
- Talked about creating different pages such as a login page(or pop-up), main menu, lesson modules, and the lesson screen
- Got recommended to use blackboard as an example for the GUI and also a website called [Roadmapsh](https://roadmap.sh/python) that will help with lesson planning

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
- Poom and Dimitry discuss what to use as the front end
- Discuss definitively what we're making. Maybe a website, application, etc.
- Create a flow/diagram as to what we want in terms of the big picture
