# Introduction

Our Project is named "Syntax Sensei", it is a Python Programming language learning website. Users will follow lessons to learn Python starting basic and getting increasingly difficult. The lessons are created by ChatGPT but are verified to be accurate and helpful by us. The project will focus on gamefying the learning similar to Duolingo but for coding.

### **Features:**
#### Functional
* The system shall allow users to create acccounts and login
* The system shall store user information such as progress and missed questions
* The system shall be gamefied for users using a "belt" system ranking up to a new belt after a specific goal is reached
#### Non-Functional
* The system shall be able to be accessed on multiple devices such as a standard mobile phone, desktop computer, and laptop
* The system shall be safe from common web vulnerabilities
* The system shall render and be fully functional on both Firefox and Google Chrome
 
# Anticipated Technologies

**Developement Tools:** VScode, Git, Github, Figma Design

**Languages:** Python, HTML, Javascript

**Frontend:** 

**Backend:** Django, SQLite, Django REST Framework

# Method/Approach

We plan to use the Phased Development model for our project. This is because we want to push out different features of the app over time. Once we have all our functional and non functional requirements and a general design we all agree on, we will first create lessons. After we create lessons, we will create saved progress starting with the users cached information. Then we will implement a login feature to store the users progress and achievements. We have other things that we would like to push out as well, but these are core functionalities.

# Estimated Timeline

### Phase 1: Design User Interactivity (Oct1-Oct5 )
Create a flow charts and UML diagrams for how the user intreacts with our website and how the general design of our website will flow. This also includes finializing our core requirements both functional and non-functional.
### Phase 2: UI prototypes and Familiarize with Technology: (Oct5-Oct12)
This phase is dedicated for the frontend developers to design a pleasant user interface utilizing something like Figma Design and changing the GUI prototype based on user feedback. Then for backend developers they are to familiarize themselves with the python libraries and other technologies as well as understanding the UML diagrams and flow charts will translate to developement.
### Phase 3: Developement (Oct12-Oct26)
Developement will begin. Backend will create the core basic functionalities of the website. Frontend will start developing the GUI focusing on primarily getting a quick working GUI so that Backend developers can test their functionalites on a GUI in the near future.
### Phase 4: Styling and Backend compatibility (Oct26-Nov9)
Backend developers will further develope functionality and test the compatibility with
### Phase 5: Lessons and security (Nov9-Nov23)
Any lose ends will be tied up in the functionality side. Then in this phase we will primarily focus on creating all of the lessons that the users will need to get a good grasp on the programming language Python. We will also focus on verifying our website will be secure for the user.
### Phase 6: Testing, Bug Fixing, and Final GUI changes (Nov23-Nov30)
In this phase we should have finished developement by now so we have now moved onto writiing test cases for our project and fixing bugs that arise
### Phase 7: Finalizing the Project for Release (Nov30-DueDate)
In this final phase we will finalize the product preparing it for release and submission.

# Anticipated Problems

### Creating an IDE Inside our Website
We think that creating an IDE for python inside of our web app and verifying all the logic works will be a difficult task.

### GUI design
When creating a GUI there are lots of possibilities to consider such as Functionality, Ease of Use, Style of GUI, and the Speed our GUI functions at.

### Security 
We think that the security of our project could be an issue especially for a project just being developed over the semester
