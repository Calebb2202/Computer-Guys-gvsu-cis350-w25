# Introduction

Our Project is a Python Programming language learning app. Users will follow lessons to learn Python starting basic and getting increasingly difficult. The lessons are created by ChatGPT but are verified to be accurate and helpful. 

**Features:**
* Code editor with outputs displayed
* Ability to search for specifc lessons
* Ability to save progress and have users come back where they left off

# Anticipated Technologies

**Developement Tools:** VScode, Git, Github, Figma Prototyping

**Languages:** Python

**Frontend:** 

**Backend:**

# Method/Approach

We plan to take an iterative model approach to our project. Since we are taking an iterative approach, we will create a prototype to which we can then iterate imrpoving the quality of each individual part of the project until we have a fully functional and polished product.

# Estimated Timeline

### Milestone 1: Prototype (2 Weeks in)
Create a rough prototype to present to users utilizing the Figma Prototype tool.
### Milestone 2: Finalize Prototype (3 Weeks in)
Get user feedback and change prototype continuing the cycle until users are our team and users are satisfied with the design.
### Milestone 3: Development (5 Weeks in)
Transition the finalized Figma design to implementation by developing the core frontend user interface and the backend logic starting with just 1 functional lesson.
### Milestone 4: Lessons (7 Weeks in)
Create the rest of the lessons for the project and verify they all are functional.
### Milestone 5: Bug Fixing and Final GUI Changes (9 Weeks in)
Find and fix final bugs in application and make any final GUI changes
### Milestone 6: Product Release (When Projecet is Due)
Realease the product with all of the stated features fully in place

# Anticipated Problems

### Creating an IDE Inside our Web App
We think that creating an IDE for python inside of our web app and verifying all the logic works will be a difficult task.

### GUI design
When creating a GUI there are lots of possibilities to consider such as Functionality, Ease of Use, Style of GUI, and the Speed our GUI functions at.
